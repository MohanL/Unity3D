3 weeks project

starbucks modelling of University of Rochester and mutliplayer avatars. 

Status Report: 

Currently we we have a 50% starbucks model in our system. we are working on adding the ceils and the ground. We are also working on adding controllable objects into the systems. (3d moving)

What we need ? : a yellow jacket 3d model.
                 convert the obj files to be like physically collidable.   
                 color
            
Project design : we need to make this whole starbucks space a closed space for users.
